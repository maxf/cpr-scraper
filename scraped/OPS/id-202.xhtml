Powers to search premises and of the rights of occupiers under section 194 of
the Enterprise Act 2002 (&lsquo;the
Act&rsquo;)</span></h2>
<a id="idid6292963" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Subject matter
and powers</h3>
<p><span class="text"><em>[In this notice, references to an officer or
officers of the OFT&#8217; shall be taken to include any competent person
authorised by the OFT under section 195(1) of the Act to exercise on its behalf
all or any of the powers conferred by section 194 of the Act.]</em>
Officers of the Office of Fair Trading (&lsquo;the OFT&rsquo;) have been
authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the
Warrant in connection with an investigation under the Act. OFT officers can be
accompanied by one or more named individuals authorised to assist them to
execute the warrant under section 194(4) of the Act. The subject matter of this
investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers and any
accompanying persons will not elaborate on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Paragraph 3 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the
named officer<sup><a href="#f1001" class="anchor">1</a></sup> and other officers and
any accompanying persons under section 194 of the Act for the purposes of the
present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a
matter of practice, produce evidence of his identity when producing the
Warrant, and identify and introduce all other officers and any accompanying
persons, unless he has reasonable grounds for believing that alerting the
occupier or any other person entitled to grant access would frustrate the
object of the search or endanger any officers or accompanying persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Officers of the OFT and any accompanying persons shall
have regard to the provisions of Code B of the Code of Practice under the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including in Scotland. A copy of Code B
of the Codes of Practice will be made available on request.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Reasonable and proportionate force may be used to enter
premises if the named officer in charge of the search is satisfied that
premises are those specified in the warrant and the occupier or any other
person entitled to grant access has refused entry or it is impossible to
communicate with the occupier or any other person entitled to grant access. If
the occupier is not present, a copy of the warrant and of the notice of the
powers to search premises and the rights of occupiers shall be left in a
prominent place on the premises, recording the date and time of the search and
the name of the named officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">If premises have been entered by force, before leaving
the named officer must make sure that they are secure either by arranging for
the occupier or the occupier&#8217;s representative to be present or by any
other appropriate means.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Unless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial
production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place at a reasonable
hour unless this might frustrate the purpose of the search; and, once officers
and any accompanying persons have entered premises under the authority of the
Warrant, they may remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue
executing the Warrant.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">The named officer shall also provide the occupier with
this Notice of the powers to search premises and the rights of
occupiers.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292965" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">OFT officers also have the power in
accordance with section 50 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to seize
material where it is not reasonably practicable, while on the premises, to
determine the extent to which it may be seized, if at all, or for the seizable
material to be separated from the non-seizable material in which it is
comprised. Where this power is to be exercised, the occupier will be given a
Notice which sets out the grounds for the exercise of the power and the rights
of persons who have an interest in the property to be seized pursuant to the
power.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292902" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Access to legal advice</h3>
<p><span class="text">When executing a warrant OFT officers are not required
to wait for an occupier or other person&#8217;s legal adviser to be present
before commencing the search.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">However, generally the OFT officers will wait for a
legal adviser before commencing a search provided the search is not
unreasonably delayed. Where the OFT officers do wait for the legal
adviser&#8217;s arrival, they will wait on the premises and all persons on the
premises will be required to adhere to appropriate instructions to ensure that
material on the premises, or on other premises, which may be relevant to the
investigation, is not interfered or tampered with.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292904" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">Furthermore, in cases where the OFT
has commenced the search without waiting for a legal adviser to arrive, the OFT
would avoid removing any material from the premises until the person&#8217;s
legal adviser has arrived and had the opportunity to make representations. This
is provided that the conclusion of the search is not unreasonably
delayed.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292969" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Witness to the search</h3>
<p><span class="text">A friend, neighbour or other person will be allowed to
witness the search if the occupier wishes unless the named officer in charge of
the search has reasonable grounds for believing that the presence of such
person would unreasonably delay the investigation or endanger officers or other
people.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292971" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">A record of the action taken,
including the grounds for refusing a request from the occupier to have a
witness to the search, will be made on the premises search record.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292916" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Protection against
self-incrimination</h3>
<p><span class="text">The OFT has the power to require any person at the
premises to provide an explanation of any document appearing to be of the
relevant kind or to state, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief,
where it may be found. This power is used to enable the OFT to direct its
search efficiently and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">It should be noted that, any statement made by a person
in response to any such requirement imposed by the named officer or other
officers or accompanying persons in exercise of their powers under paragraph
3(c) of the Warrant (the &lsquo;earlier statement&rsquo;), may only be used in
evidence against that person in the following circumstances.</span></p>
<em>On a prosecution for an offence under
section 201(2) of the Act</em>
<p><span class="text">Where that person has knowingly or recklessly made a
statement that is false or misleading in a material particular in response to
that requirement.</span></p>
<em>On a prosecution for some other
offence</em><a id="idid6292918" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">Where he makes a statement
inconsistent with the earlier statement provided evidence relating to the
earlier statement is adduced or a question relating to it is asked by him or on
his behalf in that prosecution<sup><a href="#f1002" class="anchor">2</a></sup>.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292854" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Privileged
communications</h3>
<p><span class="text">The powers under section 194 of the Act in relation to
documents and information (set out in paragraph 3(b) onwards in the Warrant) do
not apply to communications benefiting from legal professional privilege
(&lsquo;privilege&rsquo;). A person may not be required to disclose any
information or produce any document which he would be entitled to refuse to
disclose or produce on grounds of privilege in proceedings in the High Court.
However, a lawyer may be required to provide the name and address of his client
as part of an investigation being conducted under the powers in the Act.
Privilege does not apply to communications made with the intention of
furthering a criminal purpose (whether the lawyer is acting unwittingly or
culpably).</span></p>
<p><span class="text">The Act also provides a safeguard in respect of
confidential banking information. A person may not be required to disclose any
information or produce any document in respect of which he owes an obligation
of confidence by virtue of carrying on any banking business, unless the person
to whom the obligation of confidence is owed consents to the disclosure or
production or the OFT has authorised the making of the requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">If you consider that a document or information is
subject to privilege, you should provide the named officer or other officer or
accompanying person with a sufficient explanation such as to demonstrate to his
satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which
privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292856" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">If no agreement is reached during the
search as to whether the conditions for privilege have been made out in
relation to particular documents or information, the named officer will request
that the documents or information are placed in a sealed opaque bag in his
presence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements
for the safe-keeping of the documents or information by the OFT pending
resolution of the issue of privilege.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292909" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Listing of items</h3>
<a id="idid6292911" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">Unless it is impracticable in all the
circumstances, items will not be removed from the premises by the named officer
or other officers or accompanying persons until a list has been prepared by the
named officer (or other officers or accompanying persons) of all the items to
be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been
given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items
concerned, and only to those items.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292865" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Retention and copying of
items</h3>
<p><span class="text">Items seized during the search will be retained by the
OFT only for as long as is necessary in all the circumstances. For example,
material seized may be retained if it will be needed &ndash;</span></p>
<ol><li>for use in evidence in a criminal
trial;</li>
<li>to satisfy the OFT&#8217;s criminal
disclosure obligations; or</li>
<li>so that it may be subjected to forensic
examination.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="text">Material may also be retained under the provisions of
the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292867" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">On request, the OFT will, where
practicable, provide a copy of such material to the person from whom the
material was seized as soon as reasonably practicable.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292861" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Confidentiality</h3>
<p><span class="text">You should note that, subject to the safeguards in
relation to self-incrimination and communications subject to privilege, you are
<strong>not</strong> entitled to withhold a document or information by claiming
that it is confidential.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292863" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">However, section 237 of the Act
imposes limits on the disclosure of information that relates to the affairs of
any individual or any business which has been obtained by the OFT as a result
of using its powers of investigation under the Act, subject to certain
exceptions. Those exceptions include the right of the OFT to disclose
information for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the OFT of its
statutory function and the investigation of any criminal offence in any part of
the UK. The relevant provisions are in Part 9 of the Act.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292841" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Application to vary or discharge
the Warrant</h3>
<p><span class="text">You are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or
discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must
first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being
executed must be made immediately upon it being served.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">The application must be made to the judge who issued the
Warrant, or if he is not available, to another judge of the Chancery
Division.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">If you are making an immediate application to stop the
Warrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or
continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two
hours) while you make your application, provided that you &ndash;</span></p>
<ol><li>permit the named officer and other officers
[and other accompanying persons] to enter and remain on the
premises;</li>
<li>keep the named officer informed of the
steps you are taking in relation to the application;</li>
<li>provide the named officer with contact
details of the solicitor, if any, who is in receipt of your formal instructions
in relation to an application to stop the Warrant being executed;
and</li>
<li>comply with any other conditions that the
named officer imposes.</li>
</ol>
<a id="idid6292843" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">Examples of conditions that the named
officer may impose pursuant to (4) above include &ndash;</span></p>
<ol><li>that you do not disturb or move any
document or information that is the subject of the Warrant;
and/or</li>
<li>you do not tell anyone other than your
legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation.</li>
</ol>
<a id="idid6292822" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Application under section 59
Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001</h3>
<p><span class="text">Your attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal
Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating
to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other
provisions) section 194(2) of the Act.</span></p>
<a id="idid6292824" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">An application under section 59 should
be made to a judge of the Crown Court.</span></p>
