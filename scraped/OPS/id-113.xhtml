<p>the paying party may apply for an order requiring the receiving party to commence detailed assessment proceedings within such time as the court may specify.</p>
<p>(2) On an application under paragraph (1), the court may direct that, unless the receiving party commences detailed assessment proceedings within the time specified by the court, all or part of the costs to which the receiving party would otherwise be entitled will be disallowed.</p>

<p>(4) Where the costs to be assessed in a detailed assessment are payable out of the Community Legal Service Fund, this rule applies as if the receiving party were the solicitor to whom the costs are payable and the paying party were the Legal Services Commission.</p>
<p><strong>Points of dispute and consequence of not serving</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.9</strong></p>
<p>(1) The paying party and any other party to the detailed assessment proceedings may dispute any item in the bill of costs by serving points of dispute on –</p>

<p>(4) The receiving party may file a request for a default costs certificate if –</p>
<p>(a) the period set out in paragraph (2) for serving points of dispute has expired; and</p>

<p>(2) A default costs certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates.</p>
<p>(3) Where a receiving party obtains a default costs certificate, the costs payable to that party for the commencement of detailed assessment proceedings will be the sum set out in Practice Direction 47.</p>
<p>(4) A receiving party who obtains a default costs certificate in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act must send a copy of the default costs certificate to the prescribed charity.</p>

<p>(1) The court will set aside a default costs certificate if the receiving party was not entitled to it.</p>

<p>(Practice Direction 47 contains further details about the procedure for setting aside a default costs certificate and the matters which the court must take into account)</p>
<p>(3) Where the court sets aside or varies a default costs certificate in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007, the receiving party must send a copy of the order setting aside or varying the default costs certificate to the prescribed charity.</p>

<p>(a) in rule 47.7; or</p>

<p><strong>Provisional Assessment</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.15</strong></p>
<p>(1) This rule applies to any detailed assessment proceedings commenced in the High Court or a county court on or after 1 April 2013 in which the costs claimed are the amount set out in paragraph 14.1 of the practice direction supplementing this Part, or less.</p>
<p>(2) In proceedings to which this rule applies, the parties must comply with the procedure set out in Part 47 as modified by paragraph 14 Practice Direction 47.</p>
<p>(3) The court will undertake a provisional assessment of the receiving party’s costs on receipt of Form N258 and the relevant supporting documents specified in Practice Direction 47.</p>
<p>(4) The provisional assessment will be based on the information contained in the bill and supporting papers and the contentions set out in Precedent G (the points of dispute and any reply).</p>
<p>(5) In proceedings which do not go beyond provisional assessment, the maximum amount the court will award to any party as costs of the assessment (other than the costs of drafting the bill of costs) is £1,500 together with any VAT thereon and any court fees paid by that party.</p>
<p>(6) The court may at any time decide that the matter is unsuitable for a provisional assessment and may give directions for the matter to be listed for hearing. The matter will then proceed under rule 47.14 without modification.</p>
<p>(7) When a provisional assessment has been carried out, the court will send a copy of the bill, as provisionally assessed, to each party with a notice stating that any party who wishes to challenge any aspect of the provisional assessment must, within 21 days of the receipt of the notice, file and serve on all other parties a written request for an oral hearing. If no such request is filed and served within that period, the provisional assessment shall be binding upon the parties, save in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>(8) The written request referred to in paragraph (7) must –</p>
<p>(a) identify the item or items in the court’s provisional assessment which are sought to be reviewed at the hearing; and</p>
<p>(b) provide a time estimate for the hearing.</p>
<p>(9) The court then will fix a date for the hearing and give at least 14 days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing to all parties.</p>
<p>(10) Any party which has requested an oral hearing, will pay the costs of and incidental to that hearing unless –</p>
<p>(a) it achieves an adjustment in its own favour by 20% or more of the sum provisionally assessed; or</p>
<p>(b) the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p><strong>V INTERIM COSTS CERTIFICATE AND FINAL COSTS CERTIFICATE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Power to issue an interim certificate</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.16</strong></p>
<p>(1) The court may at any time after the receiving party has filed a request for a detailed assessment hearing –</p>
<p>(a) issue an interim costs certificate for such sum as it considers appropriate; or</p>
<p>(b) amend or cancel an interim certificate.</p>
<p>(2) An interim certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p>(3) The court may order the costs certified in an interim certificate to be paid into court.</p>
<p>(4) Where the court –</p>
<p>(a) issues an interim costs certificate; or</p>
<p>(b) amends or cancels an interim certificate,</p>
<p>in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the receiving party must send a copy of the interim costs certificate or the order amending or cancelling the interim costs certificate to the prescribed charity.</p>
<p><strong>Final costs certificate</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.17</strong></p>
<p>(1) In this rule a ‘completed bill’ means a bill calculated to show the amount due following the detailed assessment of the costs.</p>
<p>(2) The period for filing the completed bill is 14 days after the end of the detailed assessment hearing.</p>
<p>(3) When a completed bill is filed the court will issue a final costs certificate and serve it on the parties to the detailed assessment proceedings.</p>
<p>(4) Paragraph (3) is subject to any order made by the court that a certificate is not to be issued until other costs have been paid.</p>
<p>(5) A final costs certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p>(Practice Direction 47 deals with the form of a final costs certificate.)</p>
<p>(6) Where the court issues a final costs certificate in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the receiving party must send a copy of the final costs certificate to the prescribed charity.</p>
<p><strong>VI DETAILED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR COSTS OF A LSC FUNDED CLIENT OR AN ASSISTED PERSON WHERE COSTS ARE PAYABLE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICE FUND</strong></p>
<p><strong>Detailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of the Community Legal Services Fund</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.18</strong></p>
<p>(1) Where the court is to assess costs of a LSC funded client or an assisted person which are payable out of the Community Legal Services Fund, that person’s solicitor may commence detailed assessment proceedings by filing a request in the relevant practice form.</p>
<p>(2) A request under paragraph (1) must be filed within 3 months after the date when the right to detailed assessment arose.</p>
<p>(3) The solicitor must also serve a copy of the request for detailed assessment on the LSC funded client or the assisted person, if notice of that person’s interest has been given to the court in accordance with community legal service or legal aid regulations.</p>
<p>(4) Where the solicitor has certified that the LSC funded client or that person wishes to attend an assessment hearing, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment, fix a date for the assessment hearing.</p>
<p>(5) Where paragraph (3) does not apply, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment provisionally assess the costs without the attendance of the solicitor, unless it considers that a hearing is necessary.</p>
<p>(6) After the court has provisionally assessed the bill, it will return the bill to the solicitor.</p>
<p>(7) The court will fix a date for an assessment hearing if the solicitor informs the court, within 14 days after receiving the provisionally assessed bill, that the solicitor wants the court to hold such a hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of a fund other than the community legal service fund</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.19</strong></p>

<p>(4) The court will, on receipt of the request for assessment, provisionally assess the costs without the attendance of the receiving party, unless the court considers that a hearing is necessary.</p>
<p>(5) After the court has provisionally assessed the bill, it will return the bill to the receiving party.</p>
<p>(6) The court will fix a date for an assessment hearing if the receiving party informs the court, within 14 days after receiving the provisionally assessed bill, that the receiving party wants the court to hold such a hearing.</p>
<p><strong>VII COSTS OF DETAILED ASSESSMENT PROCEEDINGS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liability for costs of detailed assessment proceedings</strong></p>
<p><strong>47.20</strong></p>
<p>(1) The receiving party is entitled to the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings except where –</p>
<p>(a) the provisions of any Act, any of these Rules or any relevant practice direction provide otherwise; or</p>
<p>(b) the court makes some other order in relation to all or part of the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the receiving party has pro bono representation in the detailed assessment proceedings but that party may apply for an order in respect of that representation under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.</p>
<p>(3) In deciding whether to make some other order, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including –</p>
<p>(a) the conduct of all the parties;</p>
<p>(b) the amount, if any, by which the bill of costs has been reduced; and</p>
<p>(c) whether it was reasonable for a party to claim the costs of a particular item or to dispute that item.</p>
<p>(4) The provisions of Part 36 apply to the costs of detailed assessment proceedings with the following modifications –</p>
<p>(a) ‘claimant’ refers to ‘receiving party’ and ‘defendant’ refers to ‘paying party’;</p>
<p>(b) ‘trial’ refers to ‘detailed assessment hearing’;</p>
<p>(c) in rule 36.9(5), at the end insert ‘or, where the Part 36 offer is made in respect of the detailed assessment proceedings, after the commencement of the detailed assessment hearing.’;</p>
<p>(d) for rule 36.11(7) substitute ‘If the accepted sum is not paid within 14 days or such other period as has been agreed the offeree may apply for a final costs certificate for the unpaid sum.’;</p>
<p>(e) a reference to ‘judgment being entered’ is to the completion of the detailed assessment, and references to a ‘judgment’ being advantageous or otherwise are to the outcome of the detailed assessment.</p>
<p>(5) The court will usually summarily assess the costs of detailed assessment proceedings at the conclusion of those proceedings.</p>
<p>(6) Unless the court otherwise orders, interest on the costs of detailed assessment proceedings will run from the date of default, interim or final costs certificate, as the case may be.</p>
<p>(7) For the purposes of rule 36.14, detailed assessment proceedings are to be regarded as an independent claim.</p>
