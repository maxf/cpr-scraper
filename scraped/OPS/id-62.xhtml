<p>(e) the claimant failed to give his address in the claim form, or gave an incorrect address in that form;</p>

<p>(b) one or more of the conditions in paragraph (2) applies.</p>
<p>(2) The conditions are that the person –</p>

<p>(b) has contributed or agreed to contribute to the claimant’s costs in return for a share of any money or property which the claimant may recover in the proceedings; and</p>
<p>is a person against whom a costs order may be made.</p>
