<h3><a id="id1.1"></a>Preamble</h3>
<p><strong>1</strong>&nbsp; In this direction “Right to Buy Claim” means a claim made and/or brought by any person or persons claiming damages and/or equitable compensation against a solicitor or firm of solicitors (or former solicitor or firm of solicitors) who acted for the claimant or claimants on the exercise of the right to buy their council houses under the Housing Act 1985 and who did so having allegedly been advised by a mortgage broker and/or introducer where such claim is not concerned solely with an alleged defect in title or an alleged error in conveyancing.<br/></p>

<strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp; Any Right to Buy Claim which was commenced in the High Court of Justice prior to the date on which this Practice Direction was issued but which is proceeding otherwise than in the general list of the Central Registry of the Chancery Division shall be transferred to the general list of the Central Registry of the Chancery Division and assigned in the first instance to the Chief Chancery Master. Solicitors should act promptly in making any applications necessary for such transfer pursuant to CPR Parts 30.2(4) and 30.5. Such applications are to be made by letter drawing attention to this Practice Direction and no application notice pursuant to CPR Part 23 need be issued.
