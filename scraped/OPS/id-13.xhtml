<h3><a id="id1.1"></a>Scope of this practice direction</h3><strong>1.1</strong>
<p>This practice direction lists the forms to be used in civil proceedings on or after 26th April 1999, when the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) came into force.</p>
<strong>1.2</strong>
<p>The forms may be modified as the circumstances require, provided that all essential information, especially information or guidance which the form gives to the recipient, is included.</p>
<strong>1.3</strong>
<p>This practice direction contains 3 tables –</p>
<ul>
<li>Table 1 lists forms required by CPR Parts 1 to 81</li>
<li>Table 2 lists High Court forms in use before 26th April 1999 which have remained in use on or after that date (see paragraph 4 below)</li>
<li>Table 3 lists county court forms in use before 26th April 1999 that will remain in use on or after that date (see paragraph 5 below)</li>
</ul><strong>1.4</strong>
<p>Former prescribed forms are shown as ‘No 00’. The former practice forms where they are appropriate for use in either the Chancery or Queen’s Bench Division (or where no specific form is available for use in the county court, in that court also) are prefixed ‘PF’ followed by the number. Where the form is used mainly in the Chancery or Queen&#39;s Bench Division, the suffix CH or QB follows the form number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="id2.1"></a>Other forms</h3><strong>2.1</strong>
<p>Other forms may be authorised by practice directions. For example the forms relating to Part 61 Admiralty claims are authorised by, and annexed to, Practice Direction 61.</p>
<h3>Table 1</h3>
<h3>Contents</h3>
<p><strong>3.1</strong></p>
<p>This table lists the forms that are referred to and required by Rules or Practice Directions supplementing particular Parts of the CPR. A Practice Direction and its paragraphs are abbreviated by reference to the Part of the CPR which it supplements and the relevant paragraph of the Practice Direction, for example PD 34 1.2. For ease of reference, forms required for claims in the Commercial Court, Technology and Construction Court and for Admiralty claims and Arbitration claims, are separately listed.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong></p>
<p>There are Court Funds Office forms referred to in Part 37. These are not listed below. They are Form 100 (Request for Lodgment (General)), Form 201 (Request for payment out of money in court to satisfy a Part 36 offer) and Form 202 (Notice of Defendant’s consent to payment out of money in court to satisfy a Part 36 offer). It should also be noted that use of Form N242A –Offer to settle – Part 36, referred to in paragraph 1.1 of Practice Direction 36A and in the table below, is not mandatory.</p>
