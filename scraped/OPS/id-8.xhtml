<h3><a id="id1"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>1</strong> This practice direction applies where the court is considering whether to make –</p>
<p>(a) a limited civil restraint order;</p>
<p>(b) an extended civil restraint order; or</p>
<p>(c) a general civil restraint order,</p>
<p>against a party who has issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.</p>
<p>Rules 3.3(7), 3.4(6) and 23.12 provide that where a statement of case or application is struck out or dismissed and is totally without merit, the court order must specify that fact and the court must consider whether to make a civil restraint order. Rule 52.10(6) makes similar provision where the appeal court refuses an application for permission to appeal, strikes out an appellant&#39;s notice or dismisses an appeal.</p>
<h3><a id="id2.1"></a>Limited civil restraint orders</h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> A limited civil restraint order may be made by a judge of any court where a party has made 2 or more applications which are totally without merit.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> Where the court makes a limited civil restraint order, the party against whom the order is made –</p>
<p>(1) will be restrained from making any further applications in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order;</p>
<p>(2) may apply for amendment or discharge of the order provided he has first obtained the permission of a judge identified in the order; and</p>
<p>(3) may apply for permission to appeal the order and if permission is granted, may appeal the order.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong> Where a party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order –</p>
<p>(1) makes a further application in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order, such application will automatically be dismissed –</p>
<p>(a) without the judge having to make any further order; and</p>
<p>(b) without the need for the other party to respond to it;</p>
<p>(2) repeatedly makes applications for permission pursuant to that order which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if the party makes any further application for permission which is totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal, unless the judge who refused permission grants permission to appeal.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong> A party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order may not make an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) without first serving notice of the application on the other party in accordance with paragraph 2.5.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong> A notice under paragraph 2.4 must –</p>
<p>(1) set out the nature and grounds of the application; and</p>
<p>(2) provide the other party with at least 7 days within which to respond.</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong> An application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) –</p>

<p>(3) a designated civil judge or his appointed deputy.</p>
<p><strong>2.8</strong> Where a party makes an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) and permission is refused, any application for permission to appeal –</p>
<p>(1) must be made in writing; and</p>
<p>(2) will be determined without a hearing.</p>
<p><strong>2.9</strong> A limited civil restraint order –</p>
<p>(1) is limited to the particular proceedings in which it is made;</p>
<p>(2) will remain in effect for the duration of the proceedings in which it is made, unless the court otherwise orders; and</p>
<p>(3) must identify the judge or judges to whom an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1), 2.2(2) or 2.8 should be made.</p>
<h3><a id="id3.1"></a>Extended civil restraint orders</h3>

<p>(a) without the judge having to make any further order; and</p>
<p>(b) without the need for the other party to respond to it;</p>
<p>(2) repeatedly makes applications for permission pursuant to that order which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if the party makes any further application for permission which is totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal, unless the judge who refused permission grants permission to appeal.</p>
