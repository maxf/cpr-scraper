<h3>Scope of this Part</h3>
<p><strong>13.1</strong>&nbsp; The rules in this Part set out the procedure for setting aside or varying judgment entered under Part 12 (default judgment).</p>

<h3>Cases where the court must set aside judgment entered under Part 12</h3>
<p><strong>13.2</strong>&nbsp; The court must set aside<sup>(<a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/glossary">GL</a>)</sup> a judgment entered under Part 12 if judgment was wrongly entered because–</p>
<p>(a) in the case of a judgment in default of an acknowledgment of service, any of the conditions in rule 12.3(1) and 12.3(3) was not satisfied;</p>
<p>(b) in the case of a judgment in default of a defence, any of the conditions in rule 12.3(2) and 12.3(3) was not satisfied; or</p>
<p>(c) the whole of the claim was satisfied before judgment was entered.</p>

<p>(1) In any other case, the court may set aside<sup>(<a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/glossary">GL</a>)</sup> or vary a judgment entered under Part 12 if –</p>
<p>(a) the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim; or</p>
<p>(b) it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why –</p>
<p>(i) the judgment should be set aside or varied; or</p>
<p>(ii) the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim.</p>
<p>(2) In considering whether to set aside<sup>(<a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/glossary">GL</a>)</sup> or vary a judgment entered under Part 12, the matters to which the court must have regard include whether the person seeking to set aside the judgment made an application to do so promptly.</p>
<p>(Rule 3.1(3) provides that the court may attach conditions when it makes an order)</p>
<p>(Article 19(4) of the Service Regulation (which has the same meaning as in rule 6.31(e)) applies to applications to appeal a judgment in default when the time limit for appealing has expired.)</p>
