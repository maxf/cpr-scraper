<p>the claimant may obtain default judgment if Part 12 allows it.</p>
<h3><a id="id10.3"></a>The period for filing an acknowledgment of service</h3>
<p><strong>10.3</strong></p>
<p>(1) The general rule is that the period for filing an acknowledgment of service is –</p>

<p>(b) in any other case, 14 days after service of the claim form.</p>
<p>(2) The general rule is subject to the following rules –</p>
<p>(a) rule 6.35 (which specifies how the period for filing an acknowledgment of service is calculated where the claim form is served out of the jurisdiction under rule 6.32 or 6.33);</p>
<p>(b) rule 6.12(3) (which requires the court to specify the period for responding to the particulars of claim when it makes an order under that rule); and</p>
<p>(c) rule 6.37(5) (which requires the court to specify the period within which the defendant may file an acknowledgment of service calculated by reference to Practice Direction 6B when it makes an order giving permission to serve a claim form out of the jurisdiction).</p>
