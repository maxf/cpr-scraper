<p><span class="text">This Explanatory Note is provided for information only. It is not
a detailed note of the powers under the Act which are subject to interpretation
by the courts.</span></p>
<h3 class="headingblock">Subject matter and powers</h3>
<p><span class="text">Officers of the Office of Fair Trading (&lsquo;the OFT&rsquo;)
[<em>[if the Judge so orders pursuant to section 28(3A), insert the
following here and elsewhere as indicated] </em>and other persons] have
been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in
the Warrant in connection with an investigation under the Act. The subject
matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The
officers [and other persons] will not elaborate on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Paragraph 4 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named
officer<sup><a href="#f1001" class="anchor">1</a></sup> and other officers [and other
persons] under section 28 of the Act for the purposes of the present
investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of
practice, produce evidence of the identity of the other officers in addition to
his identity when producing the Warrant.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Unless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of
the Warrant and entry to premises must take place between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30
p.m. Monday to Friday and, once officers [and other persons] have entered
premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may outside those times and
whilst the Warrant remains in force, remain on the premises or re-enter the
premises to continue executing the Warrant.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809934" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Access to legal advice</h3>
<p><span class="text">You are advised to seek legal advice. If the named officer and
other officers consider it reasonable in the circumstances to do so and if they
are satisfied that you are complying with, or will comply with, such conditions
as they consider it appropriate to impose, the named officer and other officers
will grant a request to allow a reasonable time for your legal adviser to
arrive at the premises before the inspection continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">If you decide to seek legal advice you should do so promptly and
this must not unduly delay or impede the inspection. Any delay must be kept to
a strict minimum.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809936" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">If you have an in-house legal adviser on the premises, or if you
have received prior notice of the inspection, the named officer and other
officers [and other persons] will not wait for your external legal adviser to
arrive.</span></p>
<a id="idid4810006" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Self-incrimination</h3>
<a id="idid4810008" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">The named officer and other officers [and other persons] have
powers, among other matters, to search and take copies of, or extracts from,
documents covered by the Warrant, to require you to produce relevant
information which is stored in any electronic form and to require you to
provide an explanation of any such documents (which the Act defines as
including information recorded in any form). However, if your undertaking is
suspected of having committed an infringement of the Act, they cannot require
you to provide answers or statements that might involve an admission on your
part of the existence of that infringement.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">You should note also that, any statement made by a
person in response to a requirement imposed by the named officer or other
officers [or other persons] in exercise of their powers under paragraph 4 of
the Warrant, may not be used in evidence against him on a prosecution for an
offence under section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the cartel offence)
unless, in the proceedings &ndash;</span></p>
<ol type="a"><li>in giving evidence, he makes a statement
inconsistent with it, and</li>
<li>evidence relating to it is adduced, or a
question relating to it is asked, by him or on his behalf.</li>
</ol>
<a id="idid4809972" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Legally privileged
communications</h3>
<p><span class="text">The powers under section 28 of the Act to search, take copies
etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect
of any &lsquo;privileged communication&rsquo;. This is defined in section 30 of
the Act to mean a communication</span></p>
<ol type="a"><li>between a professional legal adviser and his client, or
</li>
<li>made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal
proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="text">which would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the
High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">For the purposes of section 30, a &lsquo;professional legal
adviser&rsquo; includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal
adviser.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">If you consider that a document or information is privileged, you
should provide the named officer or other officer [or other person] with
material of such a nature as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the
document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil
the conditions for it being privileged.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809974" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">If you fail to do so, you should gather together the items for
which privilege is claimed. These items will not be examined or copied unless
you reach an agreement with the named officer that they may be examined or
copied. If no agreement is reached on the day of the inspection, the named
officer will request that you make a copy of the items and place this in a
sealed envelope or package in his presence. The named officer will then discuss
with you appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of these items pending
resolution of the issue of privilege. For example, such arrangements may
include a request that your legal adviser should give (or if no legal adviser
is present, that you give), a written undertaking that the envelope or package
will be retained safely and that its contents will not be concealed, removed,
tampered with or destroyed until the issue of privilege is resolved.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809948" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Listing of items</h3>
<a id="idid4809950" class="anchor"></a>
<p><span class="text">Unless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, no item may
be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers [or other
persons] until they have prepared a list of all the items to be removed, a copy
of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable
opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only
to those items. This does not entitle you or your legal adviser to insist that
the list or its contents should take any particular form.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809901" class="anchor"></a><h3 class="headingblock">Confidentiality</h3>
<p><span class="text">You should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to
self-incrimination and legal privilege, you are <strong>not</strong> entitled to
withhold a document or information by claiming that it is confidential.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Where it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the
inspection on the premises you should identify any part or parts of any
information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential
and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For
these purposes information is confidential if it is:</span></p>
<ol type="i"><li>commercial information the disclosure of which would, or
might, significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking
to which it relates; or</li>
<li>information relating to the private affairs of an
individual the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm his
interests<sup><a href="#f1002" class="anchor">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="text">A document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it
contains confidential information.</span></p>
<a id="idid4809903" class="anchor"></a>

you make your application, provided that you</span></p>

authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the
Warrant in connection with an investigation under the EC competition rules. The
inspection of the premises has been ordered by a decision of the European

adviser, entitled to practise in one of the Member States, is privileged
where</span></p>

the European Commission and concerns the defence of the client; or</li>

<p><span class="text">Correspondence between a client and an external legal adviser who

an in-house legal adviser is not recognised by the Court of Justice as being
protected by legal privilege. However, where the in-house legal adviser is
simply reporting the statement of an external legal adviser who is entitled to
practise in one of the Member States, privilege will apply.</span></p>
