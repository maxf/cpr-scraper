<p>Contents of this Practice Direction<br></p>
<h3>Time when assessment may be carried out: rule 47.1</h3>
<p><strong>1.1</strong>&nbsp; For the purposes of rule 47.1, proceedings are concluded when the court has finally determined the matters in issue in the claim, whether or not there is an appeal, or made an award of provisional damages under Part 41.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong>&nbsp; The court may order or the parties may agree in writing that, although the proceedings are continuing, they will nevertheless be treated as concluded.</p>
<p><strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp; A party who is served with a notice of commencement (see paragraph 5.2 below) may apply to a costs judge or a district judge to determine whether the party who served it is entitled to commence detailed assessment proceedings. On hearing such an application the orders which the court may make include: an order allowing the detailed assessment proceedings to continue, or an order setting aside the notice of commencement.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong>&nbsp; A costs judge or a district judge may make an order allowing detailed assessment proceedings to be commenced where there is no realistic prospect of the claim continuing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3><span>No stay of detailed assessment where there is an appeal: rule 47.2</span></h3>
<p><strong>2</strong>&nbsp; An application to stay the detailed assessment of costs pending an appeal may be made to the court whose order is being appealed or to the court which will hear the appeal.</p>
<h3>Powers of an authorised court officer: rule 47.3</h3>
<p><strong>3.1</strong>&nbsp; The court officers authorised by the Lord Chancellor to assess costs in the Costs Office and the Principal Registry of the Family Division are authorised to deal with claims where the base costs excluding VAT do not exceed £35,000 in the case of senior executive officers, or their equivalent, and £110,000 in the case of principal officers.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong>&nbsp; Where the receiving party, paying party and any other party to the detailed assessment proceedings who has served points of dispute are agreed that the assessment should not be made by an authorised court officer, the receiving party should so inform the court when requesting a hearing date. The court will then list the hearing before a costs judge or a district judge.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong>&nbsp; In any other case a party who objects to the assessment being made by an authorised court officer must make an application to the costs judge or district judge under Part 23 setting out the reasons for the objection.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Venue for detailed assessment proceedings: rule 47.4</h3>
<p><strong>4.1</strong>&nbsp; For the purposes of rule 47.4(1) the ‘appropriate office’ means—</p>
<p>(a) the district registry or county court in which the case was being dealt with when the judgment or order was made or the event occurred which gave rise to the right to assessment, or to which it has subsequently been transferred;</p>
<p>(b) where a tribunal, person or other body makes an order for the detailed assessment of costs, a county court (subject to paragraph 4.2); or</p>
<p>(c) in all other cases, including Court of Appeal cases, the Costs Office.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong></p>
<p>(1) This paragraph applies where the appropriate office is any of the following county courts: Barnet, Bow, Brentford, Bromley, Central London, Clerkenwell and Shoreditch, Croydon, Edmonton, Ilford, Kingston, Lambeth, Mayors and City of London, Romford, Uxbridge, Wandsworth, West London, Willesden and Woolwich.</p>
<p>(2) Where this paragraph applies—</p>
<p>(a) the receiving party must file any request for a detailed assessment hearing in the Costs Office and, for all purposes relating to that detailed assessment (other than the issue of default costs certificates and applications to set aside default costs certificates), the Costs Office will be treated as the appropriate office in that case;</p>
<p>(b) default costs certificates should be issued and applications to set aside default costs certificates should be issued and heard in the relevant county court; and</p>
<p>(c) unless an order is made under rule 47.4(2) directing that the Costs Office as part of the High Court shall be the appropriate office, an appeal from any decision made by a costs judge shall lie to the Designated Civil Judge for the London Group of County Courts or such judge as the Designated Civil Judge shall nominate. The appeal notice and any other relevant papers should be lodged at the Central London Civil Justice Centre.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong></p>
<p>(1) A direction under rule 47.4(2) or (3) specifying a particular court, registry or office as the appropriate office may be given on application or on the court’s own initiative.</p>
<p>(2) Unless the Costs Office is the appropriate office for the purposes of rule 47.4(1) an order directing that an assessment is to take place at the Costs Office will be made only if it is appropriate to do so having regard to the size of the bill of costs, the difficulty of the issues involved, the likely length of the hearing, the cost to the parties and any other relevant matter.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>(b) the extra sum which will be payable by way of fixed costs and court fees if a default costs certificate is obtained.</p>
<p><strong>5.4</strong>&nbsp; Where the notice of commencement is to be served outside England and Wales the date to be inserted in the notice of commencement for the paying party to send points of dispute is a date (not less than 21 days from the date of service of the notice) which must be calculated by reference to Section IV of Part 6 as if the notice were a claim form and as if the date to be inserted was the date for the filing of a defence.</p>
<p><strong>5.5</strong></p>
<p>(1) For the purposes of rule 47.6(2) a &#39;relevant person&#39; means—</p>
<p>(a) any person who has taken part in the proceedings which gave rise to the assessment and who is directly liable under an order for costs made against that person;</p>

<p>(3) The court will generally not make an order that the person in respect of whom the application is made will be treated as a relevant person, unless within a specified time that person applies to the court to be joined as a party to the assessment proceedings in accordance with Part 19 (Parties and Group Litigation).</p>
<p><strong>5.6</strong>&nbsp; Where—</p>
<p>(a) the bill of costs is capable of being copied electronically; and</p>
<p>(b)before the detailed assessment hearing,</p>
<p>a paying party requests an electroniccopy of the bill, the receiving party must supply the paying party with a copy in its native format (for example, in Excel or an equivalent) free of charge not more than 7 days after receipt of the request.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Form and contents of bills of costs - general<strong><br></strong></h3>
<p><strong>5.7</strong>&nbsp; A bill of costs may consist of such of the following sections as may be appropriate—</p>
<p>(1) title page;</p>
<p>(2) background information;</p>
<p>(3) items of costs claimed under the headings specified in paragraph 5.12;</p>
<p>(4) summary showing the total costs claimed on each page of the bill;</p>
<p>(5) schedules of time spent on non-routine attendances; and</p>
<p>(6) the certificates referred to in paragraph 5.21.</p>
<p>If the only dispute between the parties concerns disbursements, the bill of costs shall be limited to items (1) and (2) above, a list of the disbursements in issue and brief written submissions in respect of those disbursements.</p>
<p><strong>5.8</strong>&nbsp; Where it is necessary or convenient to do so, a bill of costs may be divided into two or more parts, each part containing sections (2), (3) and (4) above. Circumstances in which it will be necessary or convenient to divide a bill into parts include the following—</p>
<p>(1) Where the receiving party acted in person during the course of the proceedings (whether or not that party also had a legal representative at that time) the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between;</p>
<p>(a) the costs claimed for work done by the legal representative; and</p>
<p>(b) the costs claimed for work done by the receiving party in person.</p>
<p>(2) Where the receiving party had pro bono representation for part of the proceedings and an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007 has been made, the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between—</p>
<p>(a) the sum equivalent to the costs claimed for work done by the legal representative acting free of charge; and</p>
<p>(b) the costs claimed for work not done by the legal representative acting free of charge.</p>
<p>(3) Where the receiving party was represented by different legal representatives during the course of the proceedings, the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between the costs payable in respect of each legal representative.</p>
<p>(4) Where the receiving party obtained legal aid or LSC funding or is a person for whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) were provided under arrangementsmadefor the purposes of that Part of that Act in respect of all or part of the proceedings, the bill must be divided into separate parts so as to distinguish between—</p>
<p>(a) costs claimed before legal aid or LSC funding was granted or before civil legal services were provided;</p>
<p>(b) costs claimed after legal aid or LSC funding was granted or after civil legal services were provided; and</p>
<p>(c) any costs claimed after legal aid or LSC funding ceased or after civil legal services ceased to be provided.</p>
<p>(5) Where the bill covers costs payable under an order or orders under which there are different paying parties the bill must be divided into parts so as to deal separately with the costs payable by each paying party.</p>
<p>(6) Where the bill covers costs payable under an order or orders, in respect of which the receiving party wishes to claim interest from different dates, the bill must be divided to enable such interest to be calculated.</p>
<p><strong>5.9</strong>&nbsp; Where a party claims costs against another party and also claims costs against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only for work done in the same period, the costs claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only can be claimed either in a separate part of the bill or in additional columns in the same part of the bill. Precedents B and C in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction show how bills should be drafted when costs are claimed against the LSC only.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>(3) if VAT is included as part of the claim for costs, the VAT number of the legal representative or other person in respect of whom VAT is claimed;</p>
<p>(4) details of all legal aid certificates, LSC certificates, certificates recording the determinations of the Director of Legal Aid Casework and relevant amendment certificates in respect of which claims for costs are included in the bill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Form and content of bills of costs: background information</h3>
<p><strong>5.11</strong>&nbsp; The background information included in the bill of costs should set out -<br></p>
<p>(1) a brief description of the proceedings up to the date of the notice of commencement;</p>
<p>(2) a statement of the status of the legal representatives’ employee in respect of whom costs are claimed and (if those costs are calculated on the basis of hourly rates) the hourly rates claimed for each such person.</p>
<p>(3) a brief explanation of any agreement or arrangement between the receiving party and his legal representatives, which affects the costs claimed in the bill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Form and content of bills of costs: heads of costs</h3>
<p><strong>5.12</strong>&nbsp; The bill of costs may consist of items under such of the following heads as may be appropriate—</p>
<p>(1) attendances at court and upon counsel up to the date of the notice of commencement;</p>
<p>(2) attendances on and communications with the receiving party;</p>
<p>(3) attendances on and communications with witnesses including any expert witness;</p>
<p>(4) attendances to inspect any property or place for the purposes of the proceedings;</p>
<p>(5) attendances on and communications with other persons, including offices of public records;</p>
<p>(6) communications with the court and with counsel;</p>
<p>(7) work done on documents:</p>
<p>(8) work done in connection with negotiations with a view to settlement if not already covered in the heads listed above;</p>
<p>(9) attendances on and communications with London and other agents and work done by them;</p>
<p>(10) other work done which was of or incidental to the proceedings and which is not already covered in the heads listed above.</p>
<p><strong>5.13</strong>&nbsp; In respect of each of the heads of costs—</p>
<p>(1) ‘communications’ means letters out e-mails out and telephone calls;</p>
<p>(2) communications, which are not routine communications, must be set out in chronological order;</p>
<p>(3) routine communications must be set out as a single item at the end of each head;</p>
<p><strong>5.14</strong>&nbsp; Routine communications are letters out, e-mails out and telephone calls which because of their simplicity should not be regarded as letters or e-mails of substance or telephone calls which properly amount to an attendance.</p>
<p><strong>5.15</strong>&nbsp; Each item claimed in the bill of costs must be consecutively numbered.</p>
<p><strong>5.16</strong>&nbsp; In each part of the bill of costs which claims items under head (1) in paragraph 5.12 (attendances at court and upon counsel) a note should be made of—</p>
<p>(1) all relevant events, including events which do not constitute chargeable items;</p>
<p>(2) any orders for costs which the court made (whether or not a claim is made in respect of those costs in this bill of costs).</p>
<p><strong>5.17</strong>&nbsp; The numbered items of costs may be set out on paper divided into columns. Precedents A, B and C in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction illustrate various model forms of bills of costs.</p>
<p><strong>5.18</strong>&nbsp; In respect of heads (2) to (10) in paragraph 5.12 above, if the number of attendances and communications other than routine communications is twenty or more, the claim for the costs of those items in that section of the bill of costs should be for the total only and should refer to a schedule in which the full record of dates and details is set out. If the bill of costs contains more than one schedule each schedule should be numbered consecutively.</p>
<p><strong>5.19</strong>&nbsp; The bill of costs must not contain any claims in respect of costs or court fees which relate solely to the detailed assessment proceedings other than costs claimed for preparing and checking the bill.</p>
<p><strong>5.20</strong>&nbsp; The summary must show the total profit costs and disbursements claimed separately from the total VAT claimed. Where the bill of costs is divided into parts the summary must also give totals for each part. If each page of the bill gives a page total the summary must also set out the page totals for each page.</p>
<p><strong>5.21</strong>&nbsp; The bill of costs must contain such of the certificates, the texts of which are set out in Precedent F of the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction, as are appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>5.22&nbsp;</strong> The following provisions relate to work done by legal representatives —</p>
<p>(1) Routine letters out, routine e-mails out and routine telephone calls will in general be allowed on a unit basis of 6 minutes each, the charge being calculated by reference to the appropriate hourly rate. The unit charge for letters out and e-mails out will include perusing and considering the routine letters in or e-mails in.</p>
<p>(2) The court may, in its discretion, allow an actual time charge for preparation of electronic communications sent by legal representatives, which properly amount to attendances provided that the time taken has been recorded.</p>
<p>(3) Local travelling expenses incurred by legal representatives will not be allowed. The definition of ‘local’ is a matter for the discretion of the court. As a matter of guidance, ‘local’ will, in general, be taken to mean within a radius of 10 miles from the court dealing with the case at the relevant time. Where travelling and waiting time is claimed, this should be allowed at the rate agreed with the client unless this is more than the hourly rate on the assessment.</p>
<p>(4) The cost of postage, couriers, out-going telephone calls, fax and telex messages will in general not be allowed but the court may exceptionally in its discretion allow such expenses in unusual circumstances or where the cost is unusually heavy.</p>
<p>(5) The cost of making copies of documents will not in general be allowed but the court may exceptionally in its discretion make an allowance for copying in unusual circumstances or where the documents copied are unusually numerous in relation to the nature of the case. Where this discretion is invoked the number of copies made, their purpose and the costs claimed for them must be set out in the bill.</p>
<p>(6) Agency charges as between principal legal representatives and their agents will be dealt with on the principle that such charges, where appropriate, form part of the principal legal representative’s charges. Where these charges relate to head (1) in paragraph 5.12 (attendances at court and on counsel) they must be included in their chronological order in that head. In other cases they must be included in head (9) (attendances on London and other agents).</p>

The receiving party will be treated as having permission to draw up a default costs certificate by virtue of this Practice Direction.</p>
<p><strong>10.4</strong>&nbsp; The issue of a default costs certificate does not prohibit, govern or affect any detailed assessment of the same costs which are payable out of the Community Legal Service Fund or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.</p>
<p><strong>10.5</strong>&nbsp; An application for an order staying enforcement of a default costs certificate may be made either–</p>

<h3>Detailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of the Community Legal Service fund or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012: rule 47.18</h3>
<p><strong>17.1</strong>&nbsp; The time for requesting a detailed assessment under rule 47.18 is within 3 months after the date when the right to detailed assessment arose.</p>
<p><strong>17.2</strong></p>
<p>(1) The request for a detailed assessment of costs must be in Form <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=507">N258A</a>. The request must be accompanied by—</p>
<p>(a) a copy of the bill of costs;</p>
<p>(b) the document giving the right to detailed assessment (see paragraph 13.3 above);</p>
<p>(c) copies of all orders made by the court relating to the costs which are to be assessed;</p>
<p>(d) copies of any fee notes of counsel and any expert in respect of fees claimed in the bill;</p>
<p>(e) written evidence as to any other disbursement which is claimed and which exceeds £500;</p>
<p>(f) the legal aid certificates, LSC certificates, certificates recording the determinations of the Director of Legal Aid Casework, any relevant amendment certificates, any authorities and any certificates of discharge, revocation or withdrawal; and</p>
<p>(g) a statement signed by the legal representative giving the representative’s name, address for service, reference, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address where available and, if the assisted person has a financial interest in the detailed assessment and wishes to attend, giving the postal address of that person, to which the court will send notice of any hearing.</p>
<p>(2) The relevant papers in support of the bill as described in paragraph 13.12 must only be lodged if requested by the costs officer.</p>
<p><strong>17.3</strong>&nbsp; Where the court has provisionally assessed a bill of costs it will send to the legal representative a notice, in Form N253 annexed to this practice direction, of the amount of costs which the court proposes to allow together with the bill itself. The legal representative should, if the provisional assessment is to be accepted, then complete the bill.</p>
<p><strong>17.4</strong>&nbsp; If the solicitor whose bill it is, or any other party wishes to make an application in the detailed assessment proceedings, the provisions of Part 23 applies.</p>
<p><strong>17.5</strong>&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the legal representative to complete the bill by entering in the bill the correct figures allowed in respect of each item, recalculating the summary of the bill appropriately and completing the Community Legal Service assessment certificate (Form <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=274">EX80A</a>).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Costs payable by the legal services commission or Lord Chancellor at prescribed rates</h3>
<p><strong>17.6</strong>&nbsp; Where the costs of an assisted person or LSC funded client or person to whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) are provided under arrangements made for the purposes of that Part of that Act are payable by another person but costs can be claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor at prescribed rates (with or without enhancement), the solicitor of the assisted person or LSC funded client or person to whom civil legal services are provided must file a legal aid/ LSC schedule in accordance with paragraph 13.2(l) above. The schedule should follow as closely as possible Precedent E of the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction.</p>
<p><strong>17.7</strong>&nbsp; The schedule must set out by reference to the item numbers in the bill of costs, all the costs claimed as payable by another person, but the arithmetic in the schedule should claim those items at prescribed rates only (with or without any claim for enhancement).</p>
<p><strong>17.8</strong> Where there has been a change in the prescribed rates during the period covered by the bill of costs, the schedule (as opposed to the bill) should be divided into separate parts, so as to deal separately with each change of rate. The schedule must also be divided so as to correspond with any divisions in the bill of costs.</p>
<p><strong>17.9</strong>&nbsp; If the bill of costs contains additional columns setting out costs claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only, the schedule may be set out in a separate document or, alternatively, may be included in the additional columns of the bill.</p>
<p><strong>17.10</strong>&nbsp; The detailed assessment of the legal aid/ LSC schedule will take place immediately after the detailed assessment of the bill of costs but on occasions, the court may decide to conduct the detailed assessment of the legal aid/ LSC schedule separately from any detailed assessment of the bill of costs. This will occur, for example, where a default costs certificate is obtained as between the parties but that certificate is not set aside at the time of the detailed assessment of the legal aid costs.</p>
<p><strong>17.11</strong>&nbsp; Where costs have been assessed at prescribed rates it is the responsibility of the legal representative to enter the correct figures allowed in respect of each item and to recalculate the summary of the legal aid/ LSC schedule.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><strong>18.1</strong>&nbsp; Rule 47.19 enables the court to direct under rule 47.19(3) that the receiving party must serve a copy of the request for assessment and copies of the documents which accompany it, on any person who has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment.</p>
<p><strong>18.2</strong>&nbsp; A person has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment if the assessment will or may affect the amount of money or property to which that person is or may become entitled out of the fund. Where an interest in the fund is itself held by a trustee for the benefit of some other person, that trustee will be treated as the person having such a financial interest unless it is not appropriate to do so. ‘Trustee’ includes a personal representative, receiver or any other person acting in a fiduciary capacity.</p>
<p><strong>18.3&nbsp;</strong> The request for a detailed assessment of costs out of the fund should be in Form N258B, be accompanied by the documents set out at paragraph 17.2(1) (a) to (e) and the following—</p>
<p>(a) a statement signed by the receiving party giving his name, address for service, reference, telephone number,</p>
<p>(b) a statement of the postal address of any person who has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment; and</p>
<p>(c) if aperson having a financial interest is a child or protected party, a statement to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>18.4&nbsp;</strong> The court will decide, having regard to the amount of the bill, the size of the fund and the number of persons who have a financial interest, which of those persons should be served and may give directions about service and about the hearing. The court may dispense with service on all or some of those persons.</p>
<p><strong>18.5&nbsp;</strong> Where the court makes an order dispensing with service on all such persons it may proceed at once to make a provisional assessment, or, if it decides that a hearing is necessary, give appropriate directions. Before deciding whether a hearing is necessary, the court may require the receiving party to provide further information relating to the bill.</p>
<p><strong>18.6</strong></p>
<p>(1) The court will send the provisionally assessed bill to the receiving party with a notice in Form <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForms.do?court_forms_num=N253&amp;court_forms_title=&amp;court_forms_category=">N253</a>. If the receiving party is legally represented the legal representative should, if the provisional assessment is to be accepted, then complete the bill.</p>
<p>(2) The court will fix a date for a detailed assessment hearing, if the receiving party informs the court within 14 days after receiving the notice in Form <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=494">N253</a>, that the receiving party wants the court to hold such a hearing.</p>
<p><strong>18.7</strong>&nbsp; The court will give at least 14 days notice of the time and place of the hearing to the receiving party and to any person who has a financial interest and who has been served with a copy of the request for assessment.</p>
<p><strong>18.8</strong>&nbsp; If any party or any person who has a financial interest wishes to make an application in the detailed assessment proceedings, the provisions of Part 23 (General Rules about Applications for Court Orders) apply.</p>
<p><strong>18.9</strong>&nbsp; If the receiving party is legally represented the legal representative must complete the bill by inserting the correct figures in respect of each item and must recalculate the summary of the bill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Costs of detailed assessment proceedings – rule 47.20: offers to settle under part 36 or otherwise</h3>
<p><strong>19&nbsp;</strong> Where an offer to settle is made, whether under Part 36 or otherwise, it should specify whether or not it is intended to be inclusive of the cost of preparation of the bill, interest and VAT. Unless the offer states otherwise it will be treated as being inclusive of these.</p>
<h3>Appeals from authorised court officers in detailed assessment proceedings: rules 47.22 to 47.25</h3>
<p><strong>20.1</strong>&nbsp; This Section relates only to appeals from authorised court officers in detailed assessment proceedings. All other appeals arising out of detailed assessment proceedings (and arising out of summary assessments) are dealt with in accordance with Part 52 and Practice Directions 52A to 52E. The destination of appeals is dealt with in accordance with the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2000.</p>
<p><strong>20.2</strong>&nbsp; In respect of appeals from authorised court officers, there is no requirement to obtain permission, or to seek written reasons.</p>
<p><strong>20.3</strong>&nbsp; The appellant must file a notice which should be in Form <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=388">N161</a> (an appellant’s notice).</p>
<p><strong>20.4</strong>&nbsp; The appeal will be heard by a costs judge or a district judge of the High Court, and is a re-hearing.</p>
<p><strong>20.5</strong>&nbsp; The appellant’s notice should, if possible, be accompanied by a suitable record of the judgment appealed against. Where reasons given for the decision have been officially recorded by the court an approved transcript of that record should accompany the notice. Where there is no official record the following documents will be acceptable—</p>
<p>(a) the officer’s comments written on the bill;</p>
<p>(b) advocates’ notes of the reasons agreed by the respondent if possible and approved by the authorised court officer.</p>
<p>When the appellant was unrepresented before the authorised court officer, it is the duty of any advocate for the respondent to make a note of the reasons promptly available, free of charge to the appellant where there is no official record or if the court so directs. Where the appellant was represented before the authorised court officer, it is the duty of the appellant’s own former advocate to make a note available. The appellant should submit the note of the reasons to the costs judge or district judge hearing the appeal.</p>
<p><strong>20.6</strong>&nbsp; Where the appellant is not able to obtain a suitable record of the authorised court officer’s decision within the time in which the appellant’s notice must be filed, the appellant’s notice must still be completed to the best of the appellant’s ability. It may however be amended subsequently with the permission of the costs judge or district judge hearing the appeal.</p>
