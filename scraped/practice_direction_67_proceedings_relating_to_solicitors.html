<h3>Proceedings in the costs office</h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp; Where a claim to which this practice direction applies is made by Part 8 claim form in the High Court in London –</p>
<p>(1) if the claim is of a type referred to in paragraphs 1(1) to (5), it must be issued in the Costs Office;</p>
<p>(2) in any other case, the claim may be issued in the Costs Office.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp; A claim which is made by Part 8 claim form in a district registry or by Part 23 application notice in existing High Court proceedings may be referred to the Costs Office.</p>
<p><strong>2.2A</strong>&nbsp; Where a claim under section 70 or 71 of the Act is made by Part 8 claim form in the Costs Office, the court will fix a date for the hearing of the claim when the claim form is issued.</p>

<p><strong>3.2</strong>&nbsp; Claims for any of the orders listed in paragraph 1 should normally be made to a Master, costs judge or district judge. Only exceptional circumstances will justify making the claim directly to a High Court Judge.</p>
