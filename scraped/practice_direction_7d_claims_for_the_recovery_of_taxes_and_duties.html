<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp; If a defence is filed, the court will fix a date for the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp; Part 26 (Case management – preliminary stage) with the exception of rules 26.2 and 26.2A,&nbsp;does not apply to claims to which this practice direction applies.</p>
<h3>At the hearing</h3>
<p><strong>3.1</strong>&nbsp; On the hearing date the court may dispose of the claim.</p>
<p>(Section 25A(1) and (2) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (‘the 2005 Act’) provides that a certificate of an officer of Revenue and Customs that, to the best of that officer’s knowledge and belief, a sum payable to the Commissioners under or by virtue of an enactment or by virtue of a contract settlement (within the meaning of section 25(6) of the 2005 Act) has not been paid, is sufficient evidence that the sum mentioned in the certificate is unpaid.)</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong>&nbsp; But exceptionally, if the court does not dispose of the claim on the hearing date it may give case management directions, which may, if the defendant has filed a defence, include allocating the case.</p>
