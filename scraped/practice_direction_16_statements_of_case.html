<p>This practice direction supplements CPR Part 16</p>
<p>Contents of this Practice Direction</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p><strong>1.1</strong>&nbsp; The provisions of Part 16 do not apply to claims in respect of which the Part 8 procedure is being used.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong>&nbsp; Where special provisions about statements of case are made by the rules and practice directions applying to particular types of proceedings, the provisions of Part 16 and of this practice direction apply only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with those rules and practice directions.</p>
<p><strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp; Examples of types of proceedings with special provisions about statements of case include –</p>
<p>(1) defamation claims (Part 53);</p>
<p>(2) possession claims (Part 55); and</p>
<p>(3) probate claims (Part 57).</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong>&nbsp; If exceptionally a statement of case exceeds 25 pages (excluding schedules) an appropriate short summary must also be filed and served.</p>
<h3>The claim form<strong><br></strong></h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp; Rule 16.2 refers to matters which the claim form must contain. Where the claim is for money, the claim form must also contain the statement of value referred to in rule 16.3.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp; The claim form must include an address at which the claimant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the claimant&#39;s address for service is the business address of his solicitor.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong>&nbsp; Where the defendant is an individual, the claimant should (if he is able to do so) include in the claim form an address at which the defendant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the defendant’s solicitors have agreed to accept service on the defendant’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong>&nbsp; Any address which is provided for the purpose of these provisions must include a postcode or its equivalent in any EEA state (if applicable), unless the court orders otherwise. Postcode information for the United Kingdom may be obtained from www.royalmail.com or the Royal Mail Address Management Guide.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong>&nbsp; If the claim form does not show a full address, including postcode, at which the claimant(s) and defendant(s) reside or carry on business, the claim form will be issued but will be retained by the court and will not be served until the claimant has supplied a full address, including postcode, or the court has dispensed with the requirement to do so. The court will notify the claimant.</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong>&nbsp; The claim form must be headed with the title of the proceedings, including the full name of each party. The full name means, in each case where it is known:</p>
<p>(a) in the case of an individual, his full unabbreviated name and title by which he is known;</p>
<p>(b) in the case of an individual carrying on business in a name other than his own name, the full unabbreviated name of the individual, together with the title by which he is known, and the full trading name (for example, John Smith ‘trading as’ or ‘T/as’ ‘JS Autos’);</p>
<p>(c) in the case of a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership (LLP)) –</p>
<p>(i) where partners are being sued in the name of the partnership, the full name by which the partnership is known, together with the words ‘(A Firm)’; or</p>
<p>(ii) where partners are being sued as individuals, the full unabbreviated name of each partner and the title by which he is known;</p>
