<p>(3) If nobody has been appointed by the court or, in the case of a protected party, has been appointed as a deputy as set out in paragraph (2), a person may act as a litigation friend if he –</p>
<p>(a) can fairly and competently conduct proceedings on behalf of the child or protected party;</p>
<p>(b) has no interest adverse to that of the child or protected party; and</p>
<p>(c) where the child or protected party is a claimant, undertakes to pay any costs which the child or protected party may be ordered to pay in relation to the proceedings, subject to any right he may have to be repaid from the assets of the child or protected party.</p>

<p>(1) Where a claim is made –</p>
<p>(a) by or on behalf of a child or protected party; or</p>
<p>(b) against a child or protected party,</p>
<p>no settlement, compromise or payment (including any voluntary interim payment) and no acceptance of money paid into court shall be valid, so far as it relates to the claim by, on behalf of or against the child or protected party, without the approval of the court.</p>
<p>(2) Where –</p>
<p>(a) before proceedings in which a claim is made by or on behalf of, or against, a child or protected party (whether alone or with any other person) are begun, an agreement is reached for the settlement of the claim; and</p>
<p>(b) the sole purpose of proceedings is to obtain the approval of the court to a settlement or compromise of the claim,</p>
<p>the claim must –</p>
<p>(i) be made using the procedure set out in Part 8 (alternative procedure for claims); and</p>
<p>(ii) include a request to the court for approval of the settlement or compromise.</p>
<p>(3) In proceedings to which Section II or Section III of Part 45 applies, the court will not make an order for detailed assessment of the costs payable to the child or protected party but will assess the costs in the manner set out in that Section.</p>

<h3>Control of money recovered by or on behalf of a child or protected party</h3>

<p>(a) money is recovered by or on behalf of or for the benefit of a child or protected party; or</p>
<p>(b) money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a child or protected party,</p>
<p>the money will be dealt with in accordance with directions given by the court under this rule and not otherwise.</p>
<p>(2) Directions given under this rule may provide that the money shall be wholly or partly paid into court and invested or otherwise dealt with.</p>
<p>(3) Where money is recovered by or on behalf of a protected party or money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a protected party, before giving directions in accordance with this rule, the court will first consider whether the protected party is a protected beneficiary.</p>
<h3>Expenses incurred by a litigation friend</h3>
<p><strong>21.12</strong></p>
<p>(1) In proceedings to which rule 21.11 applies, a litigation friend who incurs expenses on behalf of a child or protected party in any proceedings is entitled on application to recover the amount paid or payable out of any money recovered or paid into court to the extent that it –</p>
<p>(a) has been reasonably incurred; and</p>
<p>(b) is reasonable in amount.</p>
<p>(2) Expenses may include all or part of –</p>
<p>(a) a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy (as defined by section 58C(5) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990); or</p>
<p>(b) interest on a loan taken out to pay a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy or other recoverable disbursement.</p>
<p>(3) No application may be made under the rule for expenses that –</p>
<p>(a) are of a type that may be recoverable on an assessment of costs payable by or out of money belonging to a child or protected party; but</p>
<p>(b) are disallowed in whole or in part on such an assessment.</p>
<p>(Expenses which are also ‘costs’ as defined in rule 44.1(1) are dealt with under rule 46.4(2).)</p>
<p>(4) In deciding whether the expenses were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in rule 44.4(3).</p>
<p>(5) When the court is considering the factors to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the expenses, it will have regard to the facts and circumstances as they reasonably appeared to the litigation friend or to the child’s or protected party’s legal representative when the expense was incurred.</p>
<p>(6) Where the claim is settled or compromised, or judgment is given, on terms that an amount not exceeding £5,000 is paid to the child or protected party, the total amount the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) must not exceed 25% of the sum so agreed or awarded, unless the court directs otherwise. Such total amount must not exceed 50% of the sum so agreed or awarded.</p>
<h3>Appointment of a guardian of a child’s estate</h3>
<p><strong>21.13</strong></p>
<p>(1) The court may appoint the Official Solicitor to be a guardian of a child’s estate where –</p>
<p>(a) money is paid into court on behalf of the child in accordance with directions given under rule 21.11 (control of money received by a child or protected party);</p>
<p>(b) the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority notifies the court that it has made or intends to make an award to the child;</p>
<p>(c) a court or tribunal outside England and Wales notifies the court that it has ordered or intends to order that money be paid to the child;</p>
<p>(d) the child is absolutely entitled to the proceeds of a pension fund; or</p>
<p>(e) in any other case, such an appointment seems desirable to the court.</p>
<p>(2) The court may not appoint the Official Solicitor under this rule unless –</p>
<p>(a) the persons with parental responsibility (within the meaning of section 3 of the Children Act 1989<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>) agree; or</p>
<p>(b) the court considers that their agreement can be dispensed with.</p>
<p>(3) The Official Solicitor’s appointment may continue only until the child reaches 18.</p>
