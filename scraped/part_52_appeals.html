<h3>Orders to limit the recoverable costs of an appeal</h3>
<p><strong>52.9A</strong></p>
<p>(1) In any proceedings in which costs recovery is normally limited or excluded at first instance, an appeal court may make an order that the recoverable costs of an appeal will be limited to the extent which the court specifies.</p>

<p>(b) vary an award of damages made by the jury.</p>
<p>(4) The appeal court may exercise its powers in relation to the whole or part of an order of the lower court.</p>

<p>(a) refuses an application for permission to appeal;</p>
<p>(b) strikes out an appellant’s notice; or</p>
<p>(c) dismisses an appeal,</p>
<p>and it considers that the application, the appellant’s notice or the appeal is totally without merit, the provisions of paragraph (6) must be complied with.</p>
<p>(6) Where paragraph (5) applies–</p>
<p>(a) the court’s order must record the fact that it considers the application, the appellant’s notice or the appeal to be totally without merit; and<br></p>
<p>(b) the court must at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make a civil restraint order.</p>
<h3>Hearing of appeals</h3>
<p><strong>52.11</strong></p>
<p>(1) Every appeal will be limited to a review of the decision of the lower court unless –</p>
<p>(a) a practice direction makes different provision for a particular category of appeal; or</p>
<p>(b) the court considers that in the circumstances of an individual appeal it would be in the interests of justice to hold a re-hearing.</p>

<p>(a) oral evidence; or</p>
<p>(b) evidence which was not before the lower court.</p>
<p>(3) The appeal court will allow an appeal where the decision of the lower court was –</p>
<p>(a) wrong; or</p>
<p>(b) unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court.</p>
<p>(4) The appeal court may draw any inference of fact which it considers justified on the evidence.</p>
<p>(5) At the hearing of the appeal a party may not rely on a matter not contained in his appeal notice unless the appeal court gives permission.</p>
<h3>Non-disclosure of Part 36 offers and payments<br></h3>
<p><strong>52.12</strong></p>
<p>(1) The fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made must not be disclosed to any judge of the appeal court who is to hear or determine –</p>
<p>(a) an application for permission to appeal; or</p>
<p>(b) an appeal,</p>
<p>until all questions (other than costs) have been determined.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply if the Part 36 offer or payment into court is relevant to the substance of the appeal.</p>
<p>(3) Paragraph (1) does not prevent disclosure in any application in the appeal proceedings if disclosure of the fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made is properly relevant to the matter to be decided.</p>
<p>(Rule 36.3 has the effect that a Part 36 offer made in proceedings at first instance will not have consequences in any appeal proceedings. Therefore, a fresh Part 36 offer needs to be made in appeal proceedings. However, rule 52.12 applies to a Part 36 offer whether made in the original proceedings or in the appeal.)</p>
<h3>Statutory appeals – court’s power to hear any person</h3>
<p><strong>52.12A</strong></p>
