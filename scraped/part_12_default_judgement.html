<p>(b) has failed to file a defence.</p>
<p>(Part 10 contains provisions about filing an acknowledgment of service and Part 15 contains provisions about filing a defence)</p>
<h3>Claims in which default judgment may not be obtained</h3>
<p><strong>12.2</strong>&nbsp; A claimant may not obtain a default judgment –</p>
<p>(a) on a claim for delivery of goods subject to an agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>;</p>
<p>(b) where he uses the procedure set out in Part 8 (alternative procedure for claims); or</p>

<p>(Rule 20.4 makes general provision for a defendant’s counterclaim against a claimant, and rule 20.4(3) provides that Part 10 (acknowledgement of service) does not apply to a counterclaim made under that rule)</p>
<p>(3) The claimant may not obtain a default judgment if –</p>

<h3>Procedure for obtaining default judgment</h3>

<p>(a) a specified amount of money;</p>
<p>(b) an amount of money to be decided by the court;</p>
<p>(c) delivery of goods where the claim form gives the defendant the alternative of paying their value; or</p>

<p>he may still obtain a default judgment by filing a request under paragraph (1).</p>
<p>(4) In civil proceedings against the Crown, as defined in rule 66.1(2), a request for a default judgment must be considered by a Master or district judge, who must in particular be satisfied that the claim form and particulars of claim have been properly served on the Crown in accordance with section 18 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 and rule 6.10.</p>

<p>(a) deliver the goods or (if he does not do so) pay the value of the goods as decided by the court (less any payments made); and</p>
<p>(b) pay costs.</p>
<p>(Rule 12.7 sets out the procedure for deciding the amount of a judgment or the value of the goods)</p>
