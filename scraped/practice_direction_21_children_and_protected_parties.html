<h3>Procedure where the need for a litigation friend has come to an end</h3>
<p><strong>4.1</strong>&nbsp; Rule 21.9 deals with the situation where the need for a litigation friend comes to an end during the proceedings because either –</p>
<p>(1) a child who is not also a protected party reaches the age of 18 (full age) during the proceedings, or</p>

<p>(2) stating that his litigation friend’s appointment has ceased,</p>
<p>(3) giving an address for service, and</p>
<p>(4) stating whether or not he intends to carry on with or continue to defend the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong>&nbsp; If the notice states that the child intends to carry on with or continue to defend the proceedings he must subsequently be described in the proceedings as ‘A.B. (formerly a child but now of full age)’.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong>&nbsp; Whether or not a child having reached full age serves a notice in accordance with rule 21.9(4) and paragraph 4.2 above, a litigation friend may, at any time after the child has reached full age, serve a notice on the other parties that his appointment has ceased.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong>&nbsp; Where a protected party regains or acquires capacity to conduct the proceedings, an application under rule 21.9(3) must be made for an order under rule 21.9(2) that the litigation friend&#39;s appointment has ceased.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong>&nbsp; The application must be supported by the following evidence –</p>

<p>(2) a copy of any relevant order or declaration of the Court of Protection, and</p>
<p>(3) if the application is made by the protected party, a statement whether or not he intends to carry on with or continue to defend the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>4.7</strong>&nbsp; An order under rule 21.9(2) must be served on the other parties to the proceedings. The former protected party must file with the court a notice –</p>
<p>(1) stating that his litigation friend’s appointment has ceased,</p>
<p>(2) giving an address for service, and</p>
<p>(3) stating whether or not he intends to carry on with or continue to defend the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Settlement or compromise by or on behalf of a child or protected party before the issue of proceedings</h3>

<p>(2) A copy of the opinion and, unless the instructions on which it was given are sufficiently set out in it, a copy of the instructions, must be supplied to the court.</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong>&nbsp; Where in any personal injury case a claim for damages for future pecuniary loss is settled, the provisions in paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 must in addition be complied with.</p>
<p><strong>5.4</strong>&nbsp; The court must be satisfied that the parties have considered whether the damages should wholly or partly take the form of periodical payments.</p>

<p>(b) his future loss of earnings, and</p>
<p>(3) the extent and nature of the dependency.</p>
<h3>Control of money recovered by or on behalf of a child or protected party</h3>
<p><strong>8.1</strong>&nbsp; When giving directions under rule 21.11, the court –</p>
<p>(1) may direct the money to be paid into court for investment,</p>
<p>(2) may direct that certain sums be paid direct to the child or protected beneficiary, his litigation friend or his legal representative for the immediate benefit of the child or protected beneficiary or for expenses incurred on his behalf, and</p>
<p>(3) may direct that the application in respect of the investment of the money be transferred to a local district registry.</p>
<p><strong>8.2</strong>&nbsp; The court will consider the general aims to be achieved for the money in court (the fund) by investment and will give directions as to the type of investment.</p>
<p><strong>8.3</strong>&nbsp; Where a child also lacks capacity to manage and control any money recovered by him or on his behalf in the proceedings, and is likely to remain so on reaching full age, his fund should be administered as a protected beneficiary&#39;s fund.</p>
<p><strong>8.4</strong>&nbsp; Where a child or protected beneficiary is in receipt of publicly funded legal services the fund will be subject to a first charge under section 10 of the Access to Justice Act 1999<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> (statutory charge) and an order for the investment of money on the child&#39;s or protected beneficiary’s behalf must contain a direction to that effect.</p>

<p>(2) any evidence or information which the litigation friend wishes the court to consider in relation to the investment of the award for damages.</p>
<p><strong>9.2</strong>&nbsp; Following the hearing in paragraph 9.1, the court will forward to the Court Funds Office a request for investment decision (form 212) and the Court Funds Office will make the appropriate investment.</p>
<p><strong>9.3</strong>&nbsp; Where an award for damages for a child is made at trial, unless paragraph 9.7 applies, the trial judge will –</p>
<p>(1) direct the money to be paid into court and placed into the special investment account until further investment directions have been given by the court;</p>
<p>(2) direct the litigation friend to make an application to a Master or district judge for further investment directions; and</p>
<p>(3) give such other directions as the trial judge thinks fit, including a direction that the hearing of the application for further investment directions will be fixed for a date within 28 days from the date of the trial.</p>
<p><strong>9.4</strong>&nbsp; The application under paragraph 9.3(2) must be made by filing with the court –</p>
<p>(1) a completed CFO form 320; and</p>

<p><strong>10.2</strong>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>(1) Where the sum to be invested for the benefit of the protected beneficiary is £50,000 or more, (save where under paragraph 10.2A the Court of Protection has authorised a sum of £50,000 or more to be dealt with under subparagraph (2) below), unless a person with authority as –</p>
<p>(a) the attorney under a registered enduring power of attorney;</p>
<p>(b) the donee of a lasting power of attorney; or</p>

<p><strong>10.3</strong>&nbsp; A form of order transferring the fund to the Court of Protection is set out in practice form N292.</p>
<p><strong>10.4</strong>&nbsp; In order for the Court Funds Office to release a fund which is subject to the statutory charge, the litigation friend or his legal representative or the person with authority referred to in paragraph 10.2(1) must provide the appropriate regional office of the Legal Services Commission with an undertaking in respect of a sum to cover their costs, following which the regional office will advise the Court Funds Office in writing of that sum, enabling them to transfer the balance to the Court of Protection on receipt of a CFO form 200 payment schedule authorised by the court.</p>
<p><strong>10.5</strong>&nbsp; The CFO form 200 should be completed and presented to the court where the settlement or trial took place for authorisation, subject to paragraphs 10.6 and 10.7.</p>

<p>(3) where an assessment of costs under Part rule 46.4(2) is not required, and no approval under Part 21 is necessary, by a Part 23 application supported by a witness statement to a costs judge or district judge as appropriate.</p>

<p>may be dealt with without a hearing unless the court directs otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>13.2</strong>&nbsp; When the child reaches full age –</p>
